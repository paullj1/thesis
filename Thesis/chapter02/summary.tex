This chapter covered the definitions, measures of performance, and approaches that are relevant to this research as organized under the subsection of \emph{reporting} within the OFP field of study.  There has been a tremendous amount of research surrounding the topic of OFP and many prediction approaches have been presented.  Unfortunately, these approaches do not appear on modern operational systems and failures are still relatively prevalent.  Recent approaches as covered here have sought to make predictors more adaptive to the changes in underlying systems in an effort to make implementing existing failure predictors easier.  In this work, we plan to extend the adaptive failure prediction framework and further generalize the approach.
