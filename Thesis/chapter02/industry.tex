\subsection{Industry Approaches to Online Failure Prediction} \label{industry}
Because hardware has become so easy to acquire, industry has sought to avoid
the problem of software failure by implementing massive redundancy in their
systems.  The work in~\cite{watanabe2014,irrera2015} attributes the problem
avoidance to the fact that until recently, implementing and maintaining a
failure predictor was difficult.  As we decrease the length of the software
development life cycle, software updates are being published with increasing
frequency leading to rapid changes in underlying systems.  These changes can
often render a predictor useless without re-training, which is often a manual
and resource intensive process.

Redundancy is not without problems however.  Implementing redundant systems to
avoid the failure problem can be expensive and can add overhead and complexity
making a system more difficult to manage.
