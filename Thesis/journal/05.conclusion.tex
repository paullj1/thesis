\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{chapter5}
The presented \hl{targeted fault inducing loads for the} \ac{AFP} framework
extend the current \ac{AFP} framework to more effectively predict failures that
might actually occur in a production environment.  As was demonstrated with the
\ac{SVM} predictor, the underlying system changes can introduce or eliminate an
applications vulnerability to certain types of faults.  For this reason, if
\hl{these new fault loads are} implemented on \ac{MS} Windows 2008, all \hl{of
them} should be used in the execution and training phases.

An additional area of exploration should be to better identify how fault
injection actually affects the underlying system.  This research has shown that
in some cases, it can be extremely difficult to identify areas that will create
realistic failure conditions with any preceding indicators.  Even when
constrained, a single library can have hundreds of injection points.
Furthermore, in some cases, even when all injection points are tested, none may
lead to a realistic failure.  For this reason, the additional fault loads play
an integral role.  \hl{Finally, existing prediction techniques could be applied
to this same data set in order to gain more insight into when a failure may
occur and possibly increase lead time.}
