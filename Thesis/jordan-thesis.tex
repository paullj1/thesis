\chapter{Overview of Online Failure Prediction} \label{chapter2}
This chapter reviews current research regarding online failure prediction and
its many approaches to build a foundation for this research.  Further, a
taxonomy of approaches was developed here~\cite{salfnerSurvey}, this chapter
updates that taxonomy and classifies approaches since its publication using it.

\section{Background} \label{background}
In 2010, Salfner et al. published a survey paper that provides a comprehensive
summary of the state of the art on the topic of OFP~\cite{salfnerSurvey}.  In
addition to the review of the literature up to the point of publication, they
provide a summary of definitions (see Section~\ref{definitions}) and measures
of performance (see Section~\ref{metrics}) commonly used in the community for
couching the OFP discussion.
