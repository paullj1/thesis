A framework for automating the training and deployment of failure prediction
algorithms has recently been introduced.  Unfortunately, the framework was only
tested on a single deprecated operating system.  In order to generalize the
approach a few key functions must be performed, one of which being realistic
workload generation.  Unfortunately, a workload generator capable of generating
sufficient workload has not been developed for a Microsoft Windows active
directory environment.  In this paper we introduce and detail a tool that we
have developed to make the implementation of this new framework possible on a
modern Microsoft operating system, we present data generated by our tool to
demonstrate its efficacy, and finish with several extensions and applications
for our tool.
