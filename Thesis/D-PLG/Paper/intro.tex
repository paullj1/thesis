\section{Introduction}
Many ways of generating realistic traffic or capturing live traffic for replay
exist.  Unfortunately, most of these methods involve naively replaying
previously recorded traffic which cannot successfully simulate encrypted
authentication sessions.  Being able to simulate this type of encrypted traffic
is necessary to create realistic workload for modern identity management
services.  This research is the result of an ongoing attempt to generalize the
Adaptive Failure Prediction (AFP) framework developed by Irrera et al.
in~\cite{irrera2015} to predict failure in a Microsoft domain controller.

AFP automates the process of retraining a failure prediction algorithm after an
underlying system change by placing a target system under load before injecting
software faults to accelerate failure.  Consequently, in order to produce
realistic workload for an authentication service, full-stack encrypted sessions
are necessary. 

This work introduces the Distributed PowerShell Load Generator (D-PLG),
developed for generating several kinds for network traffic in modern Microsoft
Windows systems.  This work also demonstrates the validity and generalizability
of D-PLG by presenting results of several tests in a simulated production
environment.  Finally, this work demonstrates how the AFP framework leverages
D-PLG in order to generate network transactions of arbitrary arity between
unbounded network components with dynamic volume, variety, veracity, and
velocity.
