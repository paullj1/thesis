%Failure in cloud infrastructure is a relatively common occurrence due to an
%array of issues.  This problem is often masked by the use of excessively
%redundant systems in virtual environments and storage area networks, but can
%still cause service interruption.  Further, properly reasoning about failure
%reduces the need for so much infrastructure redundancy and leads to more
%efficient systems.  Fortunately, many machine learning techniques have been
%presented to predict failure.  Unfortunately, much of this work has gone unused
%due to the manual and arduous maintenance these techniques require and general
%lack of labeled training data.

Recently, a framework has been developed to automate the training of prediction
algorithms but has only been tested on one system.  In order to generalize the
approach a few key functions must be performed.  One of these functions is load
generation.  Unfortunately, a valid load generator has not been developed for a
Microsoft Windows active directory environment.  In this paper we introduce and
detail a tool that we have developed to make the implementation of this new
framework possible in a Microsoft domain, we present data generated by our tool
to demonstrate its efficacy, and finish with several extensions and
applications for our tool.
