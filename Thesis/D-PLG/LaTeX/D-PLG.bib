   There isn't really a problem statement since this is a survey, but in
   general, machines tend to fail for many reasons.  The methods described in
   this survey are for predicting failure in real-time (as opposed to
   before-hand statistical analysis).  Again, many approaches and solutions are
   presented in this survey.  Our focus is on the machine learning approaches
   that focus on error messages (or log messages).  The key takeaway for our
   work is that this helps set the stage for our problem.

   for our work is that our work enables the extension of this framework for a

   This paper suggests that machine learning based failure prediction methods

   This paper suggests a method for generating those data using software fault

   helps establish the need for a load generator.

 year = {2013},
 annotate = {
   The problem this paper suggests is that in order to conduct online failure
   prediction using machine learning in real-time, one must train a machine
   learning algorithm with real failure data.  Unfortunately, production
   systems do not fail very often and injecting failures into production
   systems is unacceptable.  The paper suggests that virtualization is a cheap
   alternative for injecting faults and collecting failure data to train
   prediction models.  The authors compare failure data collected from live
   systems with failure data collected from virtualized systems.  This paper
   helps us establish that it's okay to virtualize our experiment.
