This chapter outlines the implementation and extensions to the Adaptive Failure
Prediction (AFP) Framework as seen in~\cite{irrera2015} as well as an
experiment to validate those extensions and further generalize the framework.
The AFP was originally tested on a single system running an operating system
that has been deprecated.  Consequently, the results from the case study
conducted using the AFP are limited in utility and require generalization to be
useful to the general community.

The purpose of the AFP framework is to automate the generation of realistic
labelled failure data for the purposes of automatically training a failure
prediction algorithm.  The framework breaks down into modules so that the it
can be more easily adapted for different applications.  This chapter presents
three topics.  The first describes the process that the extended framework
executes in order to generate the labelled training data and automatically
train a failure prediction algorithm.  The second outlines each module of the
extended AFP framework and their associated extensions in detail.  The final
section outlines extensions to the AFP not covered in the other two sections.
