This chapter outlines the implementation and extensions to the Adaptive Failure
Prediction (AFP) Framework as seen in~\cite{irrera2015} as well as an
experiment to validate those extensions and further generalize the framework.
The AFP was originally tested on a single system running an operating system
that has been deprecated.  Consequently, the results from the case study
conducted using the AFP are limited in utility and require generalization to be
useful to the general community.

This chapter presents three topics.  The first outlines each module of the AFP
framework in detail.  The second describes the process that the framework
executes in order to automatically train a failure prediction algorithm to
detect pending failures in a target system.  The final outlines the extensions
and measures of performance used to evaluate the extensions.
