\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{chapter5}
This research has shown that it is possible to predict failure in modern
computer operating systems given a representative fault load.

\section{Future Work}
Future lines of research should include the following\dots

\begin{itemize}
\item{More automation using VMWare APIs}
\item{Implement more of the operators from G-SWFIT and better automate
injection/training phases}
\item{Automate the event checking process... need a way to better determine
when underlying system has changed}
\item{Implement more predictors?}
\item{Better define method for determining when to run AFP? Sliding time
window?  Machine learngin?}
\item{Continuously running AFP?  Let it run continuously in the background to
capture new failures.  The same way our tool reports failure, have a health
checking daemon running in the background that will report to syslog when
failure has occured so that it gets labelled}
\item{More data.  Use variables as recommended by Irrera et al.}
\item{Realistic data.  Get real failure data from 83/561 NOS}
\item{Implement and use the AFP to predict failure in production environment!}
\end{itemize}
