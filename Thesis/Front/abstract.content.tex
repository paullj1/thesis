As society becomes more dependent upon computer systems to perform increasingly
critical tasks, ensuring that those systems do not fail becomes increasingly
important.  Many organizations depend heavily on desktop computers for
day-to-day operations. Unfortunately, the software that runs on these computers
is written by humans and, as such, is still subject to human error and
consequent failure. A natural solution is to use statistical machine learning
to predict failure. However, since failure is still a relatively rare event,
obtaining labelled training data to train these models is not a trivial task.
This work presents new simulated fault-inducing loads that extend the focus of
traditional fault injection techniques to predict failure in the Microsoft
enterprise authentication service and Apache web server. These new fault loads
were successful in creating failure conditions that were identifiable using
statistical learning methods, with fewer \hl{irrelevant} faults being created.
