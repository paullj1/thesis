As society becomes more dependent upon computer systems to perform increasingly
critical tasks, ensuring those systems do not fail also becomes more important.
Many organizations depend heavily on desktop computers for day to day
operations. Unfortunately, the software that runs on these computers is still
written by humans and as such, is still subject to human error and consequent
failure. A natural solution is to use statistical machine learning to predict
failure. However, since failure is still a relatively rare event, obtaining
labelled training data to train these models is not trivial. This work presents
new simulated fault inducing loads \hl{which narrow the focus of traditional
fault injection techniques} to predict failure in the Microsoft enterprise
authentication service and Apache web server.  These new fault loads were
successful in creating realistic failure conditions \hl{identifiable using
statistical learning methods with fewer unnecessary faults being created}.
