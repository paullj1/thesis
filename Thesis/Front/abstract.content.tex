As society becomes more dependent upon computer systems to perform increasingly
critical tasks, ensuring those systems do not fail also becomes more important.
The Air Force, much like many other organizations, depends heavily on desktop
computers for day to day operations. Unfortunately, the software that runs on
these desktop computers is still written by humans and as such, is still
subject to human error and consequent failure. A natural solution is to use
statistical machine learning to predict failure. However, since failure is
still a relatively rare event, obtaining labelled training data to train these
models is not trivial. This work explores predicting failure in the Microsoft
enterprise authentication service using realistically generated failure data in
an effort to increase up-time in desktop computers and improve mission
effectiveness.
