As society becomes more dependent upon computer systems to perform increasingly
critical tasks, ensuring those systems do not fail also becomes more important.
Many organizations depend heavily on desktop computers for day to day
operations. Unfortunately, the software that runs on these computers is still
written by humans and as such, is still subject to human error and consequent
failure. A natural solution is to use statistical machine learning to predict
failure. However, since failure is still a relatively rare event, obtaining
labelled training data to train these models is not trivial. This work presents
new simulated fault loads with an automated framework to predict failure in the
Microsoft enterprise authentication service and Apache web server in an effort
to increase up-time and improve mission effectiveness.  These new fault loads
were successful in creating realistic failure conditions that are accurately
identified by statistical learning models.
