\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this prospectus is to outline research tasks and proposed
solutions to accomplish the NSA funded research to find a machine learning
based approach to predicting failure in our enterprise Microsoft Windows Server
infrastructure.  Every day, many of the Air Force's critical missions depend on
our computer infrastructure.  A critical piece of this infrastructure is the
authentication mechanisms that protect our sensitive information.
Unfortunately, the software at the core of this infrastructure is written and
maintained by humans and thus susceptible human error.  Fortunately, a great
deal of work has already gone into identifying good machine learning algorithms
to predict this type of failure based on warning signs that may be obfuscated
in log messages.
